11/9/21 : Set up the pages/folders, Picked out the story, Picked out colors, and got the meta tags in. No problem loading the Index page, link between Index page and Style sheet is good. Using Palette "Soft Romance" : Red Vine (#BA494B), Rosehip(#E5CBC1), and Antique (#F0E7DA). NEED to choose fonts and fallback fonts. 

11/10/21 : having troubles with the Pseudo element. Have mostly everything else done. Should I add images/a gif?

11/11/21 : I'll make it look like you opened a menu. Finally got the Pseudo element working. But the front and fonts are still a work in progress. 

11/14/21 : I can't seem to get the font I downloaded to show up. The secondary font seems to be working but Idk whats keeping the font I downloaded from showing up. The idea I had was that you would click on the braille to open the story, like if a blind person was to feel the menu and read the title. Then I was going to create some sort of nob/switch which would of changed the story from written english to braille. I still want to work on it, but I also have to turn it in.
