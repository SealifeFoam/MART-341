    Kate grew up in New England, came to Canada for university, and never left. She lives in Nova Scotia with her children and her husband, Canadian musician Bryan Potvin (The Northern Pikes.) 
    Kate began writing children's stories when her kids were little; she made up  What! just to get her son to sit still for a few minutes.
     She wrote the Princess books for her daughter, and for all girls who like smart, busy Princesses.
