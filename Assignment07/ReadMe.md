Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

The forms I've come across while browing the web are text entry, radio checkmarks, and file uploads. Text entry is used for inputing type info into specfific catigories. Radio Checkmarks are used to highlight choice for mulitulpe choice questions. And the Files uploads are used to upload files to website or form such when we need to upload assignments to moodle.   Truthfully, I see all of these, and more, on the moodle website for the students.  

List examples of text, selection, and button input, and their usage.

Text - the usage of text input is to give open ended answers without a words limit
    example: Password type box
    
Selection - the selection input is to control what restrict the end users choices. 
    example: Yes or no question choices

Button Input - the usage of Button Input is to provide a form of UX/graphic interest to the end user when they search for something
   example : the google search engine
