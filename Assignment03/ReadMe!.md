## Sort of Day by Sydney B.
On Mondays I bike downtown to the local art center to escape the day to day work of the digital arts. At the center I assist in the traditional arts and help maintain the center through cleaning. Today I did the regular cores and even found some more people to volunteer at the center.  

Here is the Center's site!\
