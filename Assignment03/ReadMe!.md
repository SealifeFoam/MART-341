# Assignment 03
## Sydney B.
### Sort of Day
On Mondays I bike downtown to the local art center to escape the day to day work of the digital arts. At the center I assist in the traditional arts and help maintain the center through cleaning. Today I did the regular cores and even found some more people to volunteer at the center.

#Three Things I Learned
 -The Wifi runs nearly on its own
 -We send files in packets of data
 -I need to read the Assignment page before doing the course tutorial instructions

Here is the Center's site!\
