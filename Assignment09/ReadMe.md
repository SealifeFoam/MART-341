Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

-Learning HTML was fun and frustrating to learn. Because of Creative Coding 1 I had learned some parts of HTML and had a handle on github. It was really got hard to learn when I hit the divs, ids and spans. 

Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

-I excited to learn more ways to stylize the web pages, this IS intro the web design after all.
