This Week was hard.
I had just started everything for this class today. I understood the content because I took Creative Coding 1, meaning I didn't have to set up a Github account, and I am talking History of Ditigal Arts and Culture. What made it hard was the set up instructions in Github, making me reread the intructions, even for this, multiple times.
