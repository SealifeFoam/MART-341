Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

    The difference between the universal, element, class and id selector types are,
    - the universal sector is used to style every element on a page. make sure you have * in tag element 
    -Element sector is used to select all elements of a certain type
    -The Class selector is used to select elements that serve the same function
    -The id selctor is used to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. 



Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes.

 The colors I choose are suppose to be linked to the art deco style of the 1920s. I chose the Art Deco style because we are currently living in the 20s of this centry. The three colors I chose are #D1AD70 (which is a gold shade), #87CCB0 (a seafoam green) and #15173D ( a dark navy blue).
