<h2>About</h2> <div class="container">
<p>I had this compulsion to create as soon as I was able to pick up a crayon. It was only a matter of time that the digital arts would of come into my reach. I thrive illustrating and learning what I donâ€™t know (which rounds up to alot). As of now, my compulsion is trying to sniff out the assignment to work from and I would be honored if I could put that urge towards your needs.  
    </p>

<p>I decided to study a major focused around graphic design because I could continue to stay close to the arts field while also being open to the modern day uses of it.</br>
     What I like most about graphic design is the ability to do more than make a drawing. With graphic design you can turn an image into a logo, an animation, or even a consumer good.</p>

    <p> I am experienced in HTML, CSS, Illustrator, Photoshop Elements, After Effects, and ClipStudio Paint, where I do most of my rough drafts. I must stress that Photoshop Elements is not the same and Adobe Photoshop, Elements takes strength in adjusting photos, but not in the advancement Photoshop has. I pride myself in keeping in contact so I can stay to what is ask of me.</p>
