Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

-The difference between divs and classes are ids are used to
uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page while classes affect several elements in your page at the same time. As for div and spans, divs element allows you to
group a set of elements together in one block-level box while the span tag allows you to contain a number of text and contain a number of inline elements. 

Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos?

-The disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or Vimeo to host a video are that they can be disconnected or won't come through. Using Vimeo is an example of a video not coming through because the site won't support it, making you have to go through Vimeo yourself to find the video. And with Youtubes algerithum you never know if your video with be still up tommorrow or in the next five minutes. I don't see any long term advantages with either of these services. 

Free Response: What challenges did you have this week? How did you overcome them?

-I am frustrated with the fact that I send my work to you but its always I can't find this file or this link won't go to the live site. I follow the directions, read and follow the turtorals given, but you never recieve them or recieve them "corretly". I am about ready to throw my computer against the wall because this keeps happening. 
And NOW my HTML page won't run/launch.
 
 -10/21/21 - still won't launch, and the textbook isn't helping me to understand how to structure <div>'s <id>'s and <span>'s.  Only thing he mentioned was that I was missing the <body> tag but even fixing that, it won't open. the only thing at this rate I'll be able to turn in is this ReadMe. 

 -10/22/21 - still won't launch correctly and Idk what to do. I'm really looking at the teacher example really closely to understand how to structure everything, but I understand about a fifth of it. I have to put comments on everything to understand what I'm working with. Can't seem to also find open audio for the assignment, I don't want to pay for it (also broke as hell), but I'm looking. ALSO, I don't understand the whole showing our location with google maps, I found that doing so can be dangerous, your either on campus in missoula or remote learning from (where ever). It's not something I want/needs to be advertised. Where would I even put it in my page? 

 -10/23/2021 - Ok I finally got it viewable. The only things wrong are the youtube link/video viewing, the U of M logo won't play, and the google maps thing. I'll only take you to the video on youtube, not on the page. I don't know where to place the google
