<h1> About</h1>
<p class="container">
    "The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed."
-Albert Einstein

It also presents a unique collection of clothing, jewelry, and plush toys designed by a team of artists and designers led by Yeni.
