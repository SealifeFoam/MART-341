Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary client is for American Mcgees company Mysterious. In general Mysterious needs a web store to sell goods made either by artist or his wife. It would also help if the site would show his patreon account to help him delvelop his games because that is his main job while the current products are ment to hype up the games and Twisted Fairy Tale culture.
